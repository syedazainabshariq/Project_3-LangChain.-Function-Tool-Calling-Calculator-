# Project_3-LangChain.-Function-Tool-Calling-Calculator-
In Project_3-LangChain, I built a function/tool calling calculator using LangChain. This project focused on creating a system where various functions were called to perform calculations based on user input, demonstrating LangChain's ability to integrate multiple tools for interactive and dynamic applications.
